This repository contains the documentation, code, and patterns for the outfit I created for Lunar Gala 2022. The outfit features computationally generated, machine stitched embroidery unified by lines of hand embroidery. The machine stitched elements represent the gererated 'cultures' on the garment. The combination of hand and machine embroidery allows for improvisational designs that flow across the garment and break the surface of the fabric in unique and experimental ways.


## Contents
### Working Code
- **[Fills](https://github.com/DavidBPerry/Thread-Cultures_LG-2022/tree/main/WorkingCode/FILLS)** - library of generative embroidered textures. 
- **[Frame Double Layer](https://github.com/DavidBPerry/Thread-Cultures_LG-2022/tree/main/WorkingCode/FRAME_DoubleLayer)** - library of frames used for the coat and pants. Includes the additional solvent lace ring on the interior. 
- **[Frame Single Layer](https://github.com/DavidBPerry/Thread-Cultures_LG-2022/tree/main/WorkingCode/FRAME_SingleLayer)** - library of frames used for the black linen top. Just a zigzag stitch circle.

### Patterns
See the [Consolidated Patterns.pdf](https://github.com/DavidBPerry/Thread-Cultures_LG-2022/blob/main/Patterns/ConsolidatedPatterns.pdf) file for the full set of garment patterns used for the top, coat, and pants. Patterns were modified from existing digital patterns purchased on Etsy, see links below for original patterns.
