# LG_2022_Lanka
 This repository contains the documentation, code, and patterns for Lanka, an outfit I created for Lunar Gala 2022. This outfit features computationally generated, machine stitched embroidery unified by lines of hand embroidery. The combination of hand and machine embroidery allows for improvisational designs that flow across the garment and break the surface of the fabric in unique and experimental ways.
